# Capstone2 Proposal




I would like to examine the stock prices of top companies in both the United States and China.  I would separate the companies into three sectors that I would like to examine: Technology, Energy and Oil, and Finance.  I would like to predict their future stock prices as well as the impact that COVID-19 had on the predictions by completing a separate prediction done in January 2020.  My MVP+ would be to examine other countries such as South Korea, United Kingdom, and Germany and possibly explore other sectors as well.  

I would extract the historical data I need for each company through Yahoo Finance to receive a csv file to read into pandas.
